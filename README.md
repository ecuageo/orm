# Orm

This is the ORM code developed as a demo for my talk "The Littlest
ORM", first for GoGaRuCo 2013 and later for other talks.

So if it has an extra few features from what you remember, that's
probably why.

## Usage

Just run "bundle exec ruby test/test_orm.rb".

That runs all the tests and verifies that it works.  And that's
basically the usage.  Mostly it's a demo, but tests prove that the
demo works!
